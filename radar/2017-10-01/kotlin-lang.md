Kotlin was initially released in 2011 and is part of the ever growing family of JVM Languages. 
It is developed by the JetBrains the creator of the IDE's we use on a daily basis. It focuses
on removing boiler-plate code and pitfalls that java brings. It grew to wide popularity in 
May of 2017 when Google offically announced to support it as a first class citizen on it's
Android Platform. It's main selling-points are higher order functions, a null aware type system, 
the use of extension functions and a solid and rich core libary. We currently adapted it's use in our 
Android Development and in a few backend teams where it's used in AWS Lambdas and in combination with spring-boot.
